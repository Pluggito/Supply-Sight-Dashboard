# 📓 Notes – Take-Home Assignment

## Approach
When I started making the dashboard, I had to calm down and think with more of a **business mindset**.  
I asked myself:  
- What would people who run businesses or attenders actually want to see?  
- What’s valuable to them?  
- How do I make it easy to use so they don’t have to stress just to get a simple task done?  

## Charts
At first, the chart logic felt a bit tricky because of the whole **“range”** requirement.  
I rethought it like this:  
- If there’s a range, then let’s generate **random demand and supply stock trends**.  
- Set up tabs for **7 days, 14 days, and 30 days** so users can easily switch between different views.  

## KPI Cards
The KPI cards were straightforward — I kept them **clean and easy to understand** so they immediately show value.  

## Trade-offs
Since it was a **take-home assignment**, I avoided:  
- Over-engineering the solution.  
- Adding unnecessary scripts or features that weren’t requested.  

I focused instead on functionality, clarity, and usability.  

## Improvements (with more time)
If I had more time, I would:  
- Improve the functionality of each part of the dashboard.  
- Make the flow even more user-friendly.  
- Add extra features if needed (e.g., deeper insights, exports, more charts, etc.).
